# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Uri website has been built with REACT JSX.



Before selecting the final libraries to be used in my project, I tried different ways to do the Uri web's sections. You can find components and pages created but finally not used in the final project.
Some of the ways created were not used because they reflected errors and I didn't have any ideas on how to fix them. It means that I should have surely more practice. Sometimes, I felt frustrated because but I kept working, looking for options, and found ways which finally worked.

Uri website needs more in CSS 
React-Bootstrap
Carousel
I've used it for doing the header

Nav

Gallery Images
