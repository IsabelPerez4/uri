Before selecting the libraries used in my project, I tried different ways to do the Uri web sections. You can find components and pages created but finally not used in the final project.

Some of the ways created were not used because they reflected errors and I didn't have any ideas on how to fix them. It means that more practice is needed. Sometimes, I felt frustrated but I kept working, looking for options, and I finally found ways that worked.

Shot and Edit by URI website needs more work with CSS to enable Gallery Container's responsive mode for mobile and tablet.
